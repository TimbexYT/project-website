Ah! Perfect — now I understand your **current alerts**. Your project tracks **these alerts**:

1. **Over Speed**
2. **Sudden Acceleration**
3. **Sudden Braking**
4. **Tilt Alert**
5. **Crash Detection**

No Gas Leak, no extra alerts.

Here’s the **updated professional website description** tailored exactly to your project:

# **Vehicle Monitoring Dashboard – Project Description**

### **Homepage / Dashboard**

**Title:** Real-Time Vehicle Monitoring Dashboard

**Description:**
This dashboard monitors vehicle safety parameters using sensors and provides **real-time alerts**. It helps drivers and fleet managers identify unsafe driving behavior and road hazards immediately.

**Current Features (Only Active Alerts):**

* **Over Speed** – Detects when vehicle speed exceeds safe limits.
* **Sudden Acceleration** – Detects rapid acceleration events.
* **Sudden Braking** – Detects abrupt braking.
* **Tilt Alert** – Detects extreme vehicle tilt or sharp turns.
* **Crash Detection** – Detects collisions or impact events.

**Visual Layout:**

* **Cards** showing live sensor readings: Speed, Acceleration, Braking, Tilt.
* **Line Graphs** showing speed and acceleration trends over time.
* **Alerts Panel** showing the latest alerts with type, severity, value, and time.

### **Alerts Page**

**Title:** Vehicle Alerts

**Description:**
All active alerts generated by the system are listed here. Each alert includes:

* **Type:** Over Speed / Sudden Acceleration / Sudden Braking / Tilt Alert / Crash
* **Value:** Current reading of the sensor
* **Severity:** High / Critical
* **Time:** When the alert occurred

**Purpose:** Quickly review safety-critical events and take action if necessary.

### **Settings Page**

**Title:** Alert Settings

**Description:**
Configure thresholds for each alert type:

* Maximum allowed speed (Over Speed)
* Acceleration threshold (Sudden Acceleration)
* Braking threshold (Sudden Braking)
* Tilt threshold (Tilt Alert)
* Crash sensitivity

> Allows customization for different vehicles or driver safety requirements.

If you want, I can now **generate a fully ready-to-use HTML + CSS + JS template** for your Replit dashboard that **includes only these 5 alerts** with:

* Live cards for Speed, Acceleration, Braking, Tilt, and Crash
* Real-time line graph for speed/acceleration
* Alerts panel showing only these alerts

Do you want me to do that?
